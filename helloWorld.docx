<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The Fourteenth Sunday after Pentecost</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">August 21, 2016</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The Rev. Robert H. Malm</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial'; font-size: 16pt; font-weight: bold;">Remember the Sabbath</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The 4</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">th</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> Commandment might be the one least followed, least taken seriously.  “Remember the Sabbath Day and keep it holy.”  Sundays have changed dramatically in American culture over the last 40 years.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">I can remember being in Seminary during the mid 1970’s and going to a parish to debate whether or not the state of </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> should change their “blue laws”.  These were laws that banned stores from being open, or alcohol being sold or served on Sundays.  40 years ago we didn’t have youth sports on Sundays.  40 years ago, movie theatres weren’t open on Sundays.  40 years ago, professional football didn’t dominate Sundays the way the NFL does today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The Sabbath, for Christians on Sunday, was a time for Church, for family, for rest.  Sunday in our culture today is pretty much like any other day in the week, except many do not have to work like they do Monday through Friday.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Our sense of the Sabbath for centuries grew out of the Judeo Christian understanding of the 4</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">th</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> Commandment, a commandment given to ancient </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> during their Exodus experience before settling in the Promised Land.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The prophet Isaiah, writing in the early 6</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">th</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> century B.C. addresses the exiles returning from the Babylonian Captivity to </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">.  He reminds them of the necessity to keep the Sabbath day holy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">“If you refrain from trampling the Sabbath, from pursuing your own interests on my holy day; if you call the Sabbath a delight and the holy day of the Lord honorable; if you honor it, not going your own way, serving your own interests, or pursuing your own affairs; then you shall take delight in the Lord…” (IS. 58:13-14)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Of course, by the time of Jesus, the Pharisees had developed a completely legalistic interpretation of the faith.  The Sabbath became a day to concentrate on the law as interpreted by Pharisaic tradition, rather than a day to give thanks for God’s love and mercy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">The Pharisees were extremely upset by the freedom Jesus brought to go beyond the law.  Jesus knew the Sabbath was a day for love, not for law, so he healed, he ate, he celebrated, he helped others.  He called the Pharisees “hypocrites”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Jesus’ freedom, especially as he observed the Sabbath, drove the Pharisees into an angry rage.  In their hatred and “fury” they took counsel to plan to “destroy” Jesus, silence and eliminate him.  Luke tells us about this early in his Gospel, in chapter 6 (6:1-11 and see also Mark 2:23-3:6). Jesus tells the Pharisees, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.”  (Mark 2:27)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">So what does Jesus want us to remember, to practice when it comes to the Sabbath?</span></p>
<p>We need time on a regular basis to give thanks to God, to praise God (as we hear in the opening verses of Psalm 103, “Bless the Lord O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name…”).  For many of us this time will be on Sunday mornings.  If Sunday doesn’t work, we need to find other Sabbath time each week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesus celebrates God’s love, mercy, healing on the Sabbath, we should also.  Where in our lives, in our world, do we need this love and healing?  How can we share God’s love with others?  It starts on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sabbath time and celebrations of worship, prayer, the sacraments all remind us of our call to witness to God’s love, God’s freedom, God’s forgiveness and to help others.  Isn’t this the combination of Isaiah’s teaching about the Sabbath as he begins “If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil, if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, then your light will rise in the darkness…” (58:9b-10)</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Jesus summarized all </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">the law by saying “Love God with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"> all your heart, all your soul, all your mind.  And love your neighbor as yourself.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">”  This is what we celebrate when we keep the Sabbath day holy.  It starts on the Sabbath and leads us to each and every new day.  </span></p>
